# SocialTime
Repository for a mobile app: "SocialTime"

This app attempts to limits a users phone use by decreasing the frequency of app notifications.

## Functionality

### Integrates social media notifications to a central hub (this app).

Ability to add different social media apps that have appropriate APIs.
Using SDKs via Javascript or Ruby for example, we can weight and filter messages and notifications.

### Able to pause notifications for a scheduled predetermined time.

For a specified period of time, notifications collections via this app will not notify the user.
Instead, the user will recieve all notificaitons after this time. 
The goal of this is to decrease the users break of concentration, by notifications constantly coming through.

### Able to add VIP contacts.

Since notificaitons will be paused for a certain perios of time, this can affect real world emergencies.
The user will be able to add different phone contacts, or social media contacts that can bypass the notification pause.

### This app can curb mobile use.

The app is able to check how often the users phone is unlocked, or an app is opened. It can then slowly trailor the frequency of notifications over a long period of time. 
    For example: 
    A user might check their phone every 90 seconds (if an app goes off or just checking your phone). During an average work day, this could decrease productivity, as well as general attention and deep concentration. This goal of the app would be to allow notificitons to initially come though every 90 second, and increase this every 30 seconds until a user only checks their phone once every 30 minutes.
